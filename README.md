Hi, I am a development engineer.

My primary focus is integration and adaptation of all kinds of data. I use different programming languages, mainly Golang and C because of their efficiency in using computational resources.

I also use .Net Core and subsequently port existing legacy solutions or develop new ones under Linux to run as online services. Code migration and MSSQL migration will also be possible, preserving the business logic of internal development. I can support the team as a consultant with practical solutions.

I also use Python all the time to compute and run AI models, such as Transformer, as a service with a good API (GPT2, NLP/NEP, Libpostal). Among the languages I use are also all JavaScript languages, both Legacy and ECMAScript or TypeScript, and even the more exotic ActionScript3 and HAXE.

I used to and still occasionally run into LAMP/LNMP solutions using PostgreSQL, MySQL and Sqlite. I have experience porting to new stacks, particularly Golang or TypeScript. 

I know how to use POSIX shell tools (SH, BASH), or rather combine them using threads and PIPE. In turn, I use them for CI/CD for various deployment systems (Gitlab, Github, Jenkins).

To isolate server solutions, I use containerization in Docker and then orchestration in Docker-Compose and porting to the right infrastructure (monolith/microservices), even AWS. I've been using VirtualBox and Vagrant virtualization for 10 years. Also qEMU and KVM. Now I'm exploring K8s as an analog. 
  
Recently, I have successfully developed a strategy for typing unstructured data using a variety of approaches, using and running AI models of both off-the-shelf services and external APIs.

Along with structuring and storing data I also found a very effective solution to depersonalize, de-organize data (documents, emails), a kind of encryption for further transmission to external services, avoiding the difficulties with the current GDPR legal framework.

If you are interested in me, contact me. I'm actively looking to apply my knowledge and would be happy to collaborate.
