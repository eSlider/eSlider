Hello, I'm an experienced software engineer with a rich history in the ever-evolving landscape of the tech industry.

## My Journey in Software Development:

I've spent years honing my skills as a development engineer, specializing in the art of seamlessly integrating and adapting diverse datasets. My toolkit includes a range of programming languages, but I have a particular affinity for Golang and C due to their exceptional resource efficiency.

In the realm of legacy solutions, I've mastered the art of porting and modernizing applications to thrive in the Linux environment, often transforming them into robust online services. Code migration and MSSQL migration are part of my repertoire, ensuring that the core business logic remains intact.

Diverse Language Proficiency:

Python is another constant companion in my coding adventures, frequently used to power AI models like Transformers, offered as services with robust APIs such as GPT2, NLP/NEP, and Libpostal. My language expertise extends to the full spectrum of JavaScript, from legacy to ECMAScript and TypeScript, and even to the more exotic realms of ActionScript3 and HAXE.

## Versatility Across Tech Stacks:

I've navigated through the world of LAMP/LNMP solutions, employing databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Sqlite. I'm well-versed in migrating these systems to newer, more efficient stacks, particularly Golang and TypeScript.

## Command Line Mastery:

Harnessing the power of POSIX shell tools, I deftly thread them together and employ pipes for seamless CI/CD across various deployment systems like Gitlab, Github, and Jenkins.

## Containerization and Orchestration:

When it comes to isolating server solutions, I turn to Docker for containerization and orchestrate them effectively using Docker-Compose. My skills extend to porting applications into the right infrastructure, whether that's a monolith or microservices architecture, even within the expansive world of AWS. Virtualization tools like VirtualBox, Vagrant, qEMU, and KVM have been my trusted companions for over a decade. Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating realm of Kubernetes as a powerful analog.

## Unstructured Data Mastery:

Recently, I've achieved significant success in taming unstructured data through a variety of innovative approaches. I've leveraged AI models from off-the-shelf services and external APIs to accomplish this feat.

Data Security and GDPR Compliance:

Beyond structuring and storing data, I've devised effective strategies to depersonalize and de-organize data, essentially providing a form of encryption for secure transmission to external services. This approach navigates the complexities of the GDPR legal framework seamlessly.

## Collaboration Awaits:

If my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology resonates with your needs, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my extensive knowledge and skills, and I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects.
