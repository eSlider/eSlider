Hi all, I'm in search of applying my knowledge in the field of online services fabrication, both turnkey and as a cloud solution on AWS.

I am primarily involved in integration and adaptation of all kinds of data. I use different programming languages, mainly Golang and C because of their efficiency in using computational resources.

I also use .Net Core and later on, to port existing legacy solutions or develop new ones to Linux to run as online services. Code migration and MSSQL migration will be possible as well, keeping the business logic of the internal development. I can support the team as a consultant offering practical solutions.

I also constantly use Python for calculations and running AI models, such as Transformer, as a service with a good API (GPT2, NLP/NEP, Libpostal). The languages I use also include all the JavaScript languages, both Legacy and ECMAScript or TypeScript, and even the more exotic ActionScript3 and HAXE.

Before and now, I occasionally encounter LAMP/LNMP solutions using PostgreSQL, MySQL and Sqlite. I have experience with porting to new stacks, more specifically Golang or TypeScript. 

I am able to use POSIX shell tools (SH, BASH), or rather combine them via threads and PIPE's. In turn I use them for CI/CD for different deployment systems (Gitlab, Github, Jenkins).

To isolate server solutions I use containerization in Docker and then orchestrate in Docker-Compose and port to the desired infrastructure(monolyth/microservices), even to AWS. For 10 years I used VirtualBox and Vagrant virtualization. Also qEMU and KVM. Right now I'm studying K8s as an analogue. 
  
Recently, I've successfully developed a strategy of typing unstructured data using various approaches, using and running AI models as turnkey services, as well as external APIs.

Along with structuring and storing data I also found a very effective solution to depersonalize, de-organize data (documents, emails), a kind of encryption for further transfer to external services, thus avoiding difficulties with the current GDPR legal framework.

If you are interested in me, contact me. I am actively searching for the application of my knowledge and will be happy to cooperate.
